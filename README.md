This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Two players can take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid, aiming to get three of their marks in a row to win. The game provides a basic UI for players to interact with and automatically detects when a player wins or when the game ends in a draw.

Two-Player Mode: Players alternate turns to place their marks ("X" or "O") on the board.
Winning Detection: The game checks for winning combinations after each move and announces the winner.
Draw Detection: If all cells are filled without a winner, the game declares a draw.
Reset Functionality: A restart button allows players to start a new game without refreshing the page.
Simple and Clean UI: The game board is designed with minimalistic styling for a clear and easy-to-use interface.
